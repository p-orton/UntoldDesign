  "description": "This project relied on stats found from Stats Canada. Through the use of colour and effective layout the propagation of victim blaming is deconstructed and the leading causes are highlighted. </br></br>With this infographic I focused on telling a story - first breaking down male attitudes, then addressing the statistics of sexual assault, and finally providing ideas for effective change."
