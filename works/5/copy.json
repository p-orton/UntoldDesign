  "description": "This project relied heavily on concept development. </br></br>Using the sentence 'the lizard king is not dead' I was able to create tension throughout the spreads and provide a visually interesting piece.  </br></br>Through the use of colour and typography the piece speaks to Morrisons true passion; poetry, and allows the audience to see a different side of the famous Doors frontman."
